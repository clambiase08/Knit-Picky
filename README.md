# Knit Picky

## Description

Knit Picky is an ecommerce web app that allows users (as customers) to shop through yarns and notions for knitting or crochet projects. Customers can click through colors on product cards in various categories (Shop All, Yarns, Accessories), add to cart, adjust or delete items from the cart, and checkout and see prior orders. Customers can also shop through a Bestsellers category which is sorted by highest number sold.
